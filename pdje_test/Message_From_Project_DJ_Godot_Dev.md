🎉 Thank You for Downloading Project DJ Godot!

Hello, and thank you for downloading Project DJ Godot!

This project is the official high-level Godot wrapper for Project DJ Engine, created to make rhythm game development easier, more powerful, and more accessible within the Godot ecosystem. With Project DJ Godot, you can harness the full capabilities of the native C++ engine without dealing with low-level implementation details.

🚀 Real-Time Updates and CI/CD Automation

Project DJ Godot is directly synchronized with the latest updates from Project DJ Engine.

It is built and distributed automatically through a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring compatibility and immediate availability.

Inside the Godot project structure (res://), you will find:

PDJE_VERSION, PDJE_WRAPPER_VERSION: version info for both the core engine and wrapper

Update_Project_DJ_Godot: a script for automated plugin updates

💡 Tip: Run the update script after your first download and whenever a new update is released to stay up to date.

❗ Note: If you experience any issues during the download or update process, it likely indicates a temporary server-side issue.
In that case, please create an issue on GitHub so we can resolve it as soon as possible.

🛠 Having Issues While Developing?

If you encounter any issues while using the wrapper or core engine, feel free to open an issue.
We also welcome pull requests (PRs) to both the Project DJ Engine and the Godot wrapper repository.
